   * FAST intends for "Features from Accelerated Segment Test". This method
   * performs a point segment test corner detection. The segment test criterion
   * operates by considering a circle of sixteen pixels around the corner
   * candidate p. The detector classifies p as a corner if there exists a set of n
   * contiguous pixelsin the circle which are all brighter than the intensity of
   * the candidate pixel Ip plus a threshold t, or all darker than Ip âˆ’ t.
